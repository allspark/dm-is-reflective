== DESCRIPTION:

 DataMapper plugin that helps you manipulate an existing database.
 It creates mappings between existing columns and model's properties.

== SYNOPSIS:

 require 'dm-mapping' # this would require 'dm-core'
 dm = DataMapper.setup :default, 'sqlite3:db/development.sqlite3'

 class User
   include DataMapper::Resource
   # mapping all, returns an array of properties indicating fields it mapped
   mapping /.*/  # e.g. => [#<Property:#<Class:0x18f89b8>:id>,
                 #          #<Property:#<Class:0x18f89b8>:title>,
                 #          #<Property:#<Class:0x18f89b8>:body>,
                 #          #<Property:#<Class:0x18f89b8>:user_id>]

   # mapping all (with no argument at all)
   mapping

   # mapping for field name ended with _at, and started with salt_
   mapping /_at$/, /^salt_/

   # mapping id and email
   mapping :id, :email

   # mapping all fields with type String, and id
   mapping String, :id

   # mapping login, and all fields with type Integer
   mapping :login, Integer
 end

 # there's no guarantee of the order in storages array
 dm.storages
 # => ['users']

 # there's no guarantee of the order in fields array
 User.fields
 # => [[:created_at,  DateTime, {:nullable => true}],
       [:email,       String,   {:nullable => true, :size => 255,
                                 :default => 'nospam@nospam.tw'}],
       [:id,          Integer,  {:nullable => false, :serial => true,
                                 :key => true}],
       [:salt_first,  String,   {:nullable => true, :size => 50}],
       [:salt_second, String,   {:nullable => true, :size => 50}]]

 dm.fields('users').sort_by{ |field| field.first.to_s } ==
        User.fields.sort_by{ |field| field.first.to_s }
 # => true

 dm.storages_and_fields
 # => {'users' => [[:id,          Integer,  {:nullable => false,
                                             :serial => true,
                                             :key => true}],
                   [:email,       String,   {:nullable => true,
                                             :default => 'nospam@nospam.tw'}],
                   [:created_at,  DateTime, {:nullable => true}],
                   [:salt_first,  String,   {:nullable => true, :size => 50}],
                   [:salt_second, String,   {:nullable => true, :size => 50}]]}

 # there's no guarantee of the order in returned array
 dm.auto_genclass!
 # => [DataMapper::Mapping::User,
       DataMapper::Mapping::SchemaInfo,
       DataMapper::Mapping::Session]

 # you can change the scope of generated models:
 dm.auto_genclass! :scope => Object
 # => [User, SchemaInfo, Session]

 # you can generate classes for tables you specified only:
 dm.auto_genclass! :scope => Object, :storages => /^phpbb_/
 # => [PhpbbUser, PhpbbPost, PhpbbConfig]

 # you can generate classes with String too:
 dm.auto_genclass! :storages => ['users', 'config'], :scope => Object
 # => [User, Config]

 # you can generate a class only:
 dm.auto_genclass! :storages => 'users'
 # => [DataMapper::Mapping::User]
